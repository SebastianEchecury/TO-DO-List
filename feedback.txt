hackathon feedback

- Technology 7/8 : includes several key technologies, such as psycopg2 for PostgreSQL database interactions, faker for generating fake data, and custom modules for password hashing and menu navigation. The implementation shows a good level of complexity in managing user activities and data.
- Completion 8/8 : fully functional, allowing users to log in, view, assign, and update activities. Both user and admin functionalities are implemented comprehensively.
- Learning 6/8: use of psycopg2 for database interactions, faker for generating test data, and implementing password hashing and verification. There is room for further learning, such as integrating an external API.
